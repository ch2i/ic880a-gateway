# The Things Network: iC880a-based gateway

Reference setup for [The Things Network](http://thethingsnetwork.org/) gateways based on the iC880a concentrator with a Raspberry Pi host.

This installer for USB version has been deprecated and if you're there, you certainly need Ch2i RPI shield so you must use this [ch2i-rpi-shield](https://github.com/ch2i/ic880a-gateway/tree/ch2i-rpi-shield) branch.


For original SPI [check this branch](https://github.com/ttn-zh/ic880a-gateway/tree/spi).
